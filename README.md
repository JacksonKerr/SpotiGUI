# SpotiGUI

A work in progress application created mainly so that I could learn how OAuth works and how to use the java Swing graphics library. The system is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi which will allow a user on the same local network as the pi to login to their Spotify account on their smartphone or other device by visiting a locally hosted webpage. The current song information and album cover of the song currently being played on their spotify account will then appear on the display connected to the pi.

Potential Later Features:
 - Media buttons on Raspberry Pi to be used with touch displays
